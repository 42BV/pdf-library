/**
 * This package contains classes that represent the eight different types of PDF objects. The package also contains
 * several classes that extend on these basic types and have a more specific implementation. An example of this is the PdfFont
 * class which extends the PdfDictionary class (one of the eight PDF object types). The implementation of PdfFont is 
 * specifically aimed at representing fonts. This simplifies the conversion from the classes found in the Api/Model 
 * package to actual PDF objects.
